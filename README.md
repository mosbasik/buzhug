# buzhug
This is a fork of Pierre Quental's BuzHug database system, made by a team of 
Caltech students taking CS 123 "Projects in Database Systems."

The purpose of this project is to create a sql parser for buzhug. This is
accomplished by the use of a Java program that accepts SQL input, translates the
input into a buzhug-formatted command, and then calls buzhug through the use of
Jython.

To compile the code, enter the javasrc directory and run the command 
"ant compile".
    
To run the program, run "ant run" from within the javasrc directory.
